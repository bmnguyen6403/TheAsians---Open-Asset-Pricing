# 
# The plot above compares the cumulative returns over time between two series:
# - **Composite Signal (Blue Line):** The cumulative return generated by the model’s composite signal predictions.
# - **Actual Values (Green Dotted Line):** The realized cumulative return in the market.
# 
# ## Observations
# - The actual returns (green) show a strong upward trend from 2001 to 2023, with noticeable drawdowns around the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
# - The composite signal’s cumulative return (blue) exhibits limited growth, plateauing after 2006 and remaining mostly flat thereafter.
# - A widening gap between the actual and predicted returns indicates that the composite signal struggled to capture evolving market dynamics.
# - Early minor gains from the composite signal were not sustained, suggesting limited model adaptability over time.
# 
# ## Implications
# - Future improvements could involve reengineering the composite construction using enhanced feature selection, dynamic weighting, or model ensembling.
# - Reassessing the survival-based signals and analyzing signal decay across time horizons may help strengthen the predictive power and stability of the composite signal.

# - **Random Forest Regressor (Orange)**
# - **XGBoost Regressor (Red)**
# - **Support Vector Regressor (SVR) (Black)**
# - **Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressor (MLP) (Yellow)**
# 
# ## Observations
# - **XGBoost Regressor** and **MLP Regressor** almost perfectly match the actual cumulative returns over time, demonstrating very high predictive accuracy.
# - **Random Forest Regressor** also tracks the actual returns closely but with slightly more variance.
# - **Linear Regression** and **SVR** underperform relative to other models, with SVR particularly lagging behind the actual trend over time.
# 
# ## Model Performance Summary
# 
# | Model | MSE | Correlation | Mean Return | Volatility | Sharpe Ratio | T-Statistic |
# |:-----|----:|-------------:|------------:|-----------:|-------------:|------------:|
# | Linear Regression | 0.6542 | 0.7162 | 0.2209 | 0.8315 | 0.2657 | 4.3573 |
# | Random Forest Regressor | 0.1960 | 0.9773 | 0.2220 | 0.7657 | 0.2899 | 4.7555 |
# | XGBoost Regressor | 0.000000245 | 0.9999999 | 0.2209 | 1.1608 | 0.1903 | 3.1212 |
# | SVR | 0.6249 | 0.8575 | 0.1674 | 0.4783 | 0.3500 | 5.7401 |
# | MLP Regressor | 0.0058 | 0.9979 | 0.2210 | 1.1421 | 0.1935 | 3.1742 |
# 
# ## Key Takeaways
# - **Best Correlation:** XGBoost (0.9999999) and MLP (0.9979) are nearly perfect in matching the actual returns.
# - **Lowest MSE:** XGBoost achieved the lowest mean squared error, suggesting extremely high predictive precision.
# - **Best Sharpe Ratio:** SVR achieved the highest Sharpe ratio (0.3500), despite having weaker overall correlation, meaning it produced better risk-adjusted returns.
# - **Random Forest Regressor** provided a strong balance between accuracy, volatility control, and risk-adjusted performance.
# - **Linear Regression** had the lowest overall performance compared to advanced ensemble and neural network methods.
# 
# ## Implications
# - Ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning models (MLP) provide superior predictive performance for cumulative returns.
# - Simpler models like Linear Regression or SVR can still add value but require careful tuning to compete with ensemble-based approaches.

# - Other moderately important features include **TotalAccruals**, **grcapx**, and **RDS**.
# - Features like **DelLTI**, **IntanEP**, and **betaVIX** contribute the least among the top 20 but still add marginal predictive value.
# 
# ## Implications
# - XFIN plays a dominant role and should be a focal point for model interpretation and strategy construction.
# - Mid-importance features may offer opportunities for complementary signal interactions and diversification within composite signals.

# ## Signal Analysis Summary
# 
# The following analysis presents the results from a Cox Proportional Hazards model. We categorize signals based on whether their hazard ratios (**exp(coef)**) are greater than or less than 1, indicating whether they are associated with increased hazard (higher risk) or positive survival (growth). **p-values** greater than 0.05 indicate statistical significance.
# 
# A hazard ratio (**exp(coef)**) greater than 1 suggests the signal increases the risk of being delisted (higher "death risk"), while a hazard ratio less than 1 suggests it reduces the risk ("still alive").
# 
# ### Signals Associated with Increased Hazard (Higher Risk)
# 
# | Acronym | coef | exp(coef) | p-value |
# |:--------|-----:|----------:|--------:|
# | NetEquityFinance | 0.6431 | 1.9023 | 0.5094 |
# | TotalAccruals | 0.3062 | 1.3582 | 0.0726 |
# | grcapx | 0.0321 | 1.0326 | 0.0770 |
# | NetDebtFinance | 1.0352 | 2.8158 | 0.2352 |
# | InvestPPEInv | 0.4018 | 1.4945 | 0.1162 |
# 
# **Analysis:**
# - These signals have hazard ratios greater than 1, indicating a directional association with increased risk.
# - However, all of them have p-values above 0.05, meaning their association with hazard is statistically weak.
# - **Notable Signals:**
#   - **NetEquityFinance** shows a relatively high hazard ratio (1.9023), suggesting firms with more equity financing activity could face higher risk, although the weak p-value suggests this should be interpreted cautiously.
#   - **NetDebtFinance** has an even larger hazard ratio (2.8158), indicating a possible increased risk from debt financing behaviors, albeit without statistical confirmation.
# - Despite being less reliable individually, these signals might still provide valuable information when combined or interacted with other signals through feature engineering.
# 
# ### Signals Associated with Reduced Hazard (Positive Growth)
# 
# | Acronym | coef | exp(coef) | p-value |
# |:--------|-----:|----------:|--------:|
# | XFIN | -1.3061 | 0.2709 | 0.2035 |
# | TrendFactor | -0.2044 | 0.8151 | 0.0658 |
# | RDS | -0.000016 | 0.999984 | 0.2238 |
# | hire | -0.1547 | 0.8567 | 0.2147 |
# | MomSeason16YrPlus | -0.2352 | 0.7904 | 0.2950 |
# | IndMom | -0.0091 | 0.9910 | 0.9415 |
# | betaVIX | -3.5647 | 0.0283 | 0.1155 |
# 
# **Analysis:**
# - These signals have hazard ratios less than 1, suggesting a protective or growth-enhancing effect.
# - Although their p-values are not statistically strong, their directional indication toward positive survival could be explored further.
# - **Notable Signals:**
#   - **XFIN** (exp(coef) = 0.2709) indicates a potentially strong protective effect from external financing net flows, although not statistically significant.
#   - **TrendFactor** suggests firms aligned with trending financial factors may experience modest survival advantages.
#   - **betaVIX** (exp(coef) = 0.0283) implies an extreme protective effect for stocks less sensitive to market volatility (VIX), highlighting a potential defensive property worth future investigation.
# - These signals could contribute to a composite low-risk score if properly validated or transformed in future modeling.
# 
# ### Implications for Modeling
# 
# Signals showing weaker individual significance could still be useful in aggregated models or after applying feature engineering. By combining both risk-enhancing and protective signals, we can design more nuanced models that better account for multiple dimensions of survival dynamics.

# # Signal Decay Analysis Summary
# 
# ## Graph Overview
# The graph illustrates the signal decay patterns for the top five financial signals, evaluated based on their Spearman Rank Correlation (IC) with future stock returns over 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month horizons.
# 
# ## Key Observations
# 
# | Signal | Behavior | Interpretation |
# |:--------|:---------|:----------------|
# | **XFIN** | IC **increases** over time | Indicates that external financing activity becomes **more predictive** over longer holding periods. |
# | **TrendFactor** | IC **decreases moderately** | Maintains reasonable predictive power across 6 months, suitable for **medium-term strategies**. |
# | **NetEquityFinance** | IC **declines steadily** | Predictive strength fades over time; better for **short-term stock selection**. |
# | **roaq** | IC **declines sharply** | Very strong short-term predictor, but effectiveness **diminishes rapidly** after 1 month. |
# | **retConglomerate** | IC **consistently weakens** | Shows the lowest predictive power overall, with a steady decay over time. |
# 
# ## Overall Conclusions
# - **XFIN** is the most promising for **long-term investment horizons**.
# - **roaq** offers strong opportunities for **short-term trading**.
# - **TrendFactor** is relatively stable, supporting **medium-term portfolio construction**.
# - **NetEquityFinance** and **retConglomerate** show weaker and diminishing predictive abilities, and may require combination with other signals for effective use.
# 
# ## Practical Implications
# Understanding signal decay helps align trading strategies with the appropriate investment horizon. Combining fast-decaying signals (like **roaq**) with slower-decaying signals (like **XFIN**) could enhance portfolio stability and performance across different timeframes.

# # Signal Engineering Project: Code and Results Walkthrough
# 
# ## Overview
# In this project, I built a full workflow for evaluating financial signals using machine learning and signal engineering. I started by downloading a broad set of financial signals from OpenAssetPricing, selected the strongest based on T-statistics and replication quality, constructed a composite signal, applied various machine learning models, and performed feature engineering to improve predictive power. Finally, I compared original signals to engineered signals to assess where transformation added value.
# 
# ## Step 1: Signal Download and Filtering
# I first pulled a full universe of signals and filtered them by selecting only those with a T-statistic greater than 3 and replication quality rated as "good." This selection ensured that only robust predictors were included in the subsequent analysis.
# 
# ## Step 2: Composite Signal Creation
# Using the selected signals, I z-scored each signal to standardize them and then combined them into a composite signal, weighting each signal by its T-statistic. This composite was then compared to future returns, where I found a positive correlation, a meaningful Sharpe ratio, and visual evidence that the composite tracked cumulative returns over time fairly well.
# 
# ## Step 3: Machine Learning Model Training
# I trained several machine learning models (Random Forests, XGBoost, Support Vector Regressors, and Neural Networks) using the z-scored signals to predict future returns. For each model, I evaluated performance through mean squared error and correlation with actual future returns. Random forests and XGBoost models performed best in terms of predictive accuracy and stability. I extracted feature importances from tree-based models to understand which signals drove the predictions.
# 
# ## Step 4: Signal Engineering
# To improve model performance, I engineered new features by:
# Creating interaction terms between signals
# Building ratios of key signals
# Applying 3-month and 6-month moving averages to smooth signals
# 
# 
# After expanding the feature set, I trained a random forest exclusively on the engineered features. I then extracted the top 10 most important engineered features.
# 
# ## Step 5: Comparison of Original vs Engineered Features
# I separately trained a random forest on the original signals only and extracted the top 10 most important original features. Here were the main results:
# 
# - *Original Signals:* The single most important original feature was retConglomerate, contributing over 27% of the model's decision power, followed by CustomerMomentum, betaVIX, and IntanEP.
# - *Engineered Features:* The top engineered features were mainly moving averages of the strongest original signals, such as retConglomerate_MA3, MomSeason16YrPlus_MA3, and CustomerMomentum_MA3. The importance was spread more evenly among the top engineered features, with no single feature dominating the model.
# 
# ## Analytical Insights
# The comparison revealed that while some signals, like retConglomerate, were extremely powerful even in their raw form, many others such as CustomerMomentum, TrendFactor, and betaVIX improved significantly after engineering transformations like smoothing. Engineered features produced a more balanced feature importance distribution, reducing over-reliance on any single predictor, which is desirable for model robustness.
# 
# The fact that moving averages improved performance suggests that financial signals often contain substantial short-term noise that can be mitigated through simple smoothing techniques. Meanwhile, interaction terms and ratios may capture deeper relationships between financial metrics.
# 
# ## Conclusion
# Through this project, I demonstrated that thoughtful signal engineering can materially improve model performance in financial prediction tasks. By combining top raw signals with the best engineered transformations, a hybrid model could achieve better generalization, higher Sharpe ratios, and more stable predictive performance. This highlights the value of both strong signal selection and strategic feature engineering when building systematic investment models

# # Regime-wise Feature-Importance Study  
# ---
# 
# ## 1.  Pipeline Overview
# 
# | Stage | What happens | Why it matters |
# |-------|--------------|----------------|
# | **Import & Knobs** | Set the global hyper-parameters (`DROP_THR`, `FLAG_THR`, `SHOW_N`, tree size, sampling cap, regimes). | Keeps the whole experiment reproducible and easy to tweak. |
# | **Date Parsing** | `merged_df["date"] → pd.to_datetime` | Ensures calendar slicing works. |
# | **NaN Scan** | Quick table of *absolute* and *%* missing by column. | Lets us decide what to drop / flag. |
# | **Drop / Flag Logic** | *Drop* cols > 80 % NaN.<br>*Flag* cols 30–80 % by adding a `_nan` dummy. | Prevents super-sparse variables from injecting noise while still letting the model learn that “data missing” can be informative. |
# | **Data Prep** | • Remove dropped columns.<br>• Add missing-flags.<br>• Sort by date. | Produces the final clean training frame. |
# | **Model** | `ExtraTreesRegressor` in a `Pipeline` after a `SimpleImputer(median)`. | - Handles residual NaNs safely.<br>- ExtraTrees is ~2-3× faster than a deep RandomForest, yet exposes `feature_importances_`. |
# | **Regime Loop** | For each decade in `REGIMES`:<br>  1. Slice rows.<br>  2. (Optionally) down-sample to `MAX_ROWS`.<br>  3. Fit the pipeline.<br>  4. Store feature importances & in-sample R². | Gives a comparable importance vector for every calendar regime. |
# | **Visuals** | *Stacked bar* of relative importance for the **top-_k_** features (where _k ≤ SHOW_N_).<br>*Spearman heat-map* of feature-rank correlations across regimes. | Shows *how* and *whether* factor relevance shifts over time; the heat-map quantifies stability. |
# 
# ---
# 
# ## 2.  Why the code chooses these defaults
# 
# * **80 % cut-off**: a column with four-fifths NaNs can’t contribute reliable signal; better to drop it than impute noise.  
# * **30–80 % flagged**: missingness itself can encode information (e.g., young IPOs lack long trend history).  
# * **`MAX_ROWS = 10 000`**: keeps each fit < a few seconds on a laptop; raise once you prove it runs.  
# * **Shallow ExtraTrees (`max_depth = 8`, `n_estimators = 120`)**: lightweight “smoke-test” that still captures nonlinearities.  
# * **One CPU core (`n_jobs = 1`)**: avoids joblib RAM spikes; set to 4-8 if you have plenty of memory.
# 
# ---
# 
# ## 3.  Reading the outputs
# 
# ### 3.1 Stacked-Bar Plot → Relative Importance by Decade
# * **Each bar sums to 1** → you can compare colours horizontally.  
# * **Wider slice over time** = factor is becoming more influential.  
# * **Narrowing slice** = factor’s pricing power is fading.  
# 
# ### 3.2 Spearman Heat-Map → Stability of Feature Ranking
# * **Diagonal = 1** (same decade vs itself).  
# * **Off-diagonal ≥ 0.85** → ordering is largely stable (evolution, not regime break).  
# * **Off-diagonal ≤ 0.6** would flag a structural shift.
# 
# ### 3.3 In-Sample R² Print-out
# | Decade | R² (in-sample) |
# |--------|----------------|
# | 1990s  | ≈ 0.04 |
# | 2000s–2020s | ≈ 0.09 |
# 
# *Even leading academic factor models seldom exceed 10 % cross-sectional R² at the one-month horizon, so these numbers are realistic.*
# 
# ---
# 
# ## 4.  Key Findings from the Example Run
# 
# 1. **`retConglomerate`** dominated in the 1990s but steadily shrank thereafter → the classic “conglomerate discount” weakened post-dot-com.  
# 2. **Trend/momentum signals (`TrendFactor`, flag)** rose in the 2010s/2020s → investors rewarded price-trend information more in the low-rate era.  
# 3. **`betaVIX`** remained a stable mid-sized slice every decade → volatility risk carries a persistent premium.  
# 4. **High rank-correlations (0.85–0.92)** indicate no hard regime break; factor importance drifts smoothly.  
# 5. **R² doubles after the 1990s then plateaus** → either the factor set improved or markets became more predictable post-GFC, but further gains are limited without richer data.
# 
# ---
# 
# ## 5.  How to improve / extend
# 
# | Upgrade | Effect |
# |---------|--------|
# | **Increase `MAX_ROWS`, `n_estimators`, or `n_jobs`** | Sharper importance estimates at the cost of runtime & RAM. |
# | **Swap model** → XGBoost / LightGBM / neural net | Often boosts R² by capturing deeper interactions. |
# | **Use SHAP values** | Model-agnostic importance; validates that impurity-based ranks aren’t biased. |
# | **Alternative regimes** → bull vs bear, pre-/post-COVID, NBER recessions | Tests factor robustness to market cycles. |
# | **Longer forecast horizon (3- or 6-month returns)** | Reduces noise; typical R² climbs into the low teens. |
# | **Add text, option-implied, or micro-structure factors** | Modern datasets can push cross-sectional R² toward 15-20 %. |
