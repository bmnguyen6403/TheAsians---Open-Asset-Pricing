This likely accounts for our relative underperformance.,"Define Accruals as net income (ib) minus operating cash flow (oancf), divided by average total assets (at) for years t-1 and t. If oancf is missing, replace operating cash flow with funds from operations (fopt) minus the annual change in total current assets (act) plus the annual change in cash and short-term investments (che) plus the annual change in current liabilities (lct) minus the annual change in debt in current liabilities (dlc). For each year t and 2-digit sic code, regress Accruals on: the inverse of average total assets for year t-1, the change in revenue (sale) from year t-1 to t divided by total assets for t-1, propery plant and equipment (ppegt) divided by total assets for t-1.  AbnormalAccrual is the residual from this cross-sectional regression.  See code for more details."
