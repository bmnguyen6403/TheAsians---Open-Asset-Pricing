    Welcome to the Stock Return Prediction Dashboard!

    This project explores several financial hypotheses:
    - Can composite signals beat individual predictors?
    - Do weighted predictors improve accuracy?
    - How do signals decay over time?
    - Can we estimate when a stock might 'die' using survival analysis?
    - Can engineered signals reveal new insights?
    - Do regime-aware models outperform static ones?

    Navigate through the tabs to explore each question.
