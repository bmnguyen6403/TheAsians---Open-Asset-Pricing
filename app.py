    **Problem Statement**  
    This project applies machine learning to forecast stock returns using survival analysis, signal decay, and composite signal construction. It focuses on building strong predictors from multiple financial signals and evaluating their performance in different market regimes.

    **Core Question**  
    Can many individually weak but statistically significant signals be combined into powerful predictors that outperform classic factors like value, momentum, and quality?

    **Research Focus**
    - Which signals help stocks avoid large crashes?
    - How does predictive power fade over time?
    - Do weighted signals outperform raw ones?
    - How do models behave across market regimes?
    - Can survival models reveal hidden risks?

    **Hypotheses**
    - **H1**: Composite signals outperform individual ones.  
    - **H2**: Weighted signals improve accuracy.  
    - **H3**: Composite signals are more robust to decay.  
    - **H4**: Regime-aware models outperform static models.

            The **Composite Signal** significantly underperforms compared to the **Actual Market** returns. The blue line represents the **Composite Signal**, which seems to lag behind the market, especially during periods of sharp growth. The green dashed line represents the **Actual Market**, which shows much higher returns, particularly after 2010. This highlights potential areas where the composite signal might be missing market trends or signals.

            **Linear Regression** captures the general trend of the **Actual Returns** well, but it struggles with larger fluctuations. The predicted returns (blue line) tend to smooth out market extremes, failing to track steep drops or spikes accurately. The model does a good job of reflecting the overall upward trend but lacks precision in volatile periods, such as the 2008 financial crisis. This suggests that linear models may not fully capture market complexities. Further improvements in model complexity, such as adding more features, might improve its predictive power.

However, it still shows some lag in more turbulent periods, particularly around 2008, suggesting that the model might need further tuning. The MLP is smoother and more adaptable, but it still misses sharp fluctuations, which may limit its performance in extreme market scenarios.

The predictions from **SVR** appear smoother and less responsive to extreme market volatility, which might be due to how **SVR** handles outliers and its regularization methods.
